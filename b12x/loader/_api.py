    This experimental primitive uses buffered pread (or mmap for ``file`` storage),
    independently of the vLLM adapter's O_DIRECT transport. It performs no dtype
    conversion or H2D copy.
    Reads finish before publishing the tensor. Its storage owns the allocation
    through tensor views and aliases; the final release waits for device work.
    Retain the tensor while replaying any graph that references its address.
    Checkpoint files must remain immutable during loading. With ``file`` storage,
    they must remain immutable for the entire tensor lifetime.

    Args:
        path: Local file containing the raw tensor bytes.
        shape: Contiguous tensor shape, including scalar and empty shapes.
        dtype: PyTorch dtype of the stored bytes.
        offset: Absolute byte offset in the file.
        allocation: ``system``, ``pinned``, ``pinned_wc``, ``registered``, ``managed``,
            or ``file``. System/file allocations require GPU host page tables.
            File mappings may not meet a kernel's alignment needs.
        device: CUDA device index that will consume the tensor.

    Returns:
        A CUDA tensor owning the loaded bytes, independent of the file handle.
