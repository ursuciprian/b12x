# MoE execution model and scheduler convergence

All kernels implement the same logical graph:

1. route each token to `top_k` experts;
2. compute expert-local FC1;
3. apply the activation and any intermediate quantization;
4. compute expert-local FC2;
5. reduce weighted routes to token order.

The public `quant_mode` names historically bundled numeric semantics, source
storage, prepared storage, scheduling, and graph partitioning.  `MoESpec` and
`MoEExecutionPlan` in `b12x.moe.execution` name those choices independently.

## Independent axes

`MoESpec` describes semantics and numerics:

- checkpoint source format and source scale encoding;
- activation operand and scale encodings;
- compute-time weight scale encoding;
- activation, IO and accumulator types, W13 order, and router-weight placement.

`MoEExecutionPlan` describes a lowering:

- route layout: direct top-k, append-only expert rows, or sorted/padded rows;
- work availability: inline, precomputed, or streamed;
- scheduler: direct, persistent grid, materialized atomic queue, or ready queue;
- GEMM engine and prepared weight layout;
- output reduction and tile geometry.

The canonical numeric recipes are:

| Recipe | Activation operand / scale | Weight source scale | Compute weight scale |
|---|---|---|---|
| NVFP4 W4A4 | FP4 E2M1 / E4M3 K/16 | E4M3 K/16 | E4M3 K/16 |
| W4A8 on NVFP4 | MXFP8 E4M3 / E8M0 K/32 | E4M3 K/16 | E8M0 K/32 base × K/16 residual |
| native W4A8-MX | MXFP8 E4M3 / E8M0 K/32 | E8M0 K/32 | E8M0 K/32 |
| W4A16 | BF16 / none | E4M3 K/16 or E8M0 K/32 | source-preserving |

## Coupled trellis transforms

Trellis-coded expert weights arrive in the BTX container
(``docs/btx-checkpoint-format.md``), which stores a fixed-rate trellis
payload for each expert matrix. Its coupled transform declaration applies
the same exact activation-boundary coordinate change at K2, K3, and K4:

```text
expert input
  -> normalized 512-wide Hadamard
  -> shared gate/up input scale
  -> ordinary 128-wide gate/up transforms
  -> compact trellis FC1
  -> inverse ordinary transforms
  -> coupled gate/up signs and 128-wide transforms
  -> coordinatewise gated activation
  -> coupled 128-wide post-activation transform
  -> ordinary down-projection transform
  -> compact trellis FC2
  -> route reduction
  -> inverse 512-wide residual transform
```

The extra transforms are an exact reparameterization before weight
quantization. They do not alter the unquantized expert function. Gate and up
share one input scale, and the intermediate rotation tensor stores the three
ordinary projection rows followed by two preactivation rows and one
post-activation row. The local hidden width must be divisible by 512 and the
local intermediate width by 128.

The BTX manifest declares the transform explicitly (``hadamard.coupled``
with its block widths). Ordinary per-matrix transforms remain valid only for
artifacts whose metadata specifies them; the runtime does not infer transform
type from the trellis bit rate.

The W4A16 path keeps BF16 activation operands. The W4A8 path evaluates the
same transform contract, quantizes the FC1 and FC2 activation operands to
MXFP8, and decodes the same compact E4M3 weight labels directly into tensor-core
operands. Both paths require caller-owned fixed scratch and support CUDA graph
replay without runtime allocation.

The current kernel families map onto those axes as follows:

| Family | Route layout | Availability | Scheduler | Weight memory |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| direct micro W4A4 / W4A8-on-NVFP4 | direct top-k | inline | direct | source-native |
| unified dynamic W4A4/W4A8 | append-only expert rows; direct top-k at tiny M | precomputed, or experimental streaming | atomic queue, persistent grid, fixed arithmetic domain, or ready queue | MMA views; native W4A8 uses N256/K128 QMMA repack |
| native NVFP4 W4A16 decode | direct top-k | inline | persistent grid | source-native payload and block scales |
| W4A16 tensor-core | sorted/padded; direct at small M for MMA-packed weights | precomputed; inline at small M | persistent grid | native payload and scales for AUTO; MMA-packed payload and scales for uniform A16 |

## Sharing NVFP4 storage across activation precisions

**Implemented:** both ModelOpt NVFP4 W4A16 consumers read the same packed
FP4 payload and swizzled E4M3 K/16 block-scale allocations as W4A4. It uses BF16
activation inputs and raw weight global scales. It does not quantize activation
operands to FP4 or convert weight scales to an MXFP8 representation.

Create an `ActivationMode.AUTO` weight plan and separate execution-capacity
plans over its prepared owner. Prepare each execution plan before freezing
kernel resolution and capturing graphs. A `moe.decode` configuration override
can select A4 or A16 explicitly for a capacity. `PackedWeights` accepts raw weight
global scales; A4 preparation derives its runtime alphas from those globals and
the reciprocal activation scales. A16 retains raw weight globals and supplies
unit activation scales.

**Implemented:** `ActivationMode.AUTO` prepares both consumers from one
`PackedWeights` bundle and selects precision through `moe.decode` during
`PreparationSession.prepare`. It requires ModelOpt NVFP4, BF16 IO, SiLU, source-native
packing, and up/gate (`W13Layout.W13`) row order. Supply raw weight globals
and both reciprocal activation scales. The A16 consumer retains raw weight
globals and performs no activation-scale arithmetic.

Each declared capacity in the composite plan's `variants` retains its selected
backend and route configuration. Separate decode and prefill capacity plans can share
one prepared expert owner. Binding and replay perform no precision search.
Explicit A4 and A16 modes retain their requested precision.

With autotuning enabled, preparation races eligible A4 and native A16
configurations using the supplied benchmark calls. The lowest median latency
wins; exact ties favor A16. A16 remains eligible at larger capacities through
expert-packed routing. Without autotuning, the default on SM120 and SM121 is
native A16 direct decode at capacities 1–8 when the kernel supports the geometry,
and A4 otherwise. `moe.decode` candidate contract revision 5 invalidates
selections made without the native direct candidate and the A16 tie preference.

The direct native decode kernel supports one through eight tokens subject to
its model-geometry contract. Declare the required counts in
`ExecutionCapacity.warmup_token_counts`; preparation retains direct launches
for both int32 and int64 route IDs. A bound count without an exact prepared
variant uses the capacity plan's expert-packed route. Mapped routes and
activation-amax collection also use expert-packed routing. Direct launches
remain available after module caches are cleared and kernel resolution is frozen.

Native A16 preparation aliases the source block scales for direct and
tensor-core execution. The tensor-core consumer stages native scale bytes into
fixed tile-sized shared memory and assembles MMA operands inline. Preparation,
prewarm, binding, and replay retain no second model-sized scale layout.

Uniform `ActivationMode.A16` requires `WeightPacking.MMA_PACKED`. Preparation
reuses the input weight storage and retains only the permuted block scales.
Release the caller's source bundle after transferring ownership to reclaim its
source-scale allocations. Uniform A16 cannot request source-native packing;
use AUTO for precision switching over shared NVFP4 storage.

`benchmarks/benchmark_w4a16_nvfp4_layouts.py` compares both A16 layouts through
public planned execution, with checkpoint provenance, pointer and byte-identity
checks, A16 oracles, frozen-resolution graph capture, fixed scratch, and
interleaved warm- or cold-cache replay. It separately gates A4 prefill and
A4/A16 switching against the NVFP4 oracle. Shared storage alone does not imply
latency parity or qualification of the precision-switching path.

## Why queue versus grid exists

There are two scheduler questions:

1. **When is a compute tile knowable?** This determines whether the work
   source must understand readiness.
2. **How uniform is the cost of the knowable tiles?** This determines whether
   fixed arithmetic ownership or dynamic work stealing is preferable.

The production dynamic kernel histograms routes, appends expert rows, crosses a
resident-grid barrier, materializes every work item, and crosses a second
barrier before expert compute.  Its consumer therefore sees a complete,
addressable domain.  An atomic claim is not enforcing a data dependency; it is
load balancing already-published work.

That makes both persistent-grid assignment and a materialized queue legal.  It
does not make them equally fast.  Partial expert tiles, differing slice counts,
memory locality, and scatter contention give fused items enough cost variance
that work stealing often wins.  Where a phase becomes rectangular and
equal-cost, arithmetic assignment wins: native W4A8's materialized FC2 phase
uses a flattened grid-stride domain after the queued FC1 phase.

The resulting rule is:

- streamed publication requires a readiness-aware queue;
- materialized work permits either a grid or a non-readiness queue;
- choose per phase from measured cost variance, not activation precision.

## Common work-source contract

The dynamic consumer acquires one register-resident item:

```text
DynamicWorkItem
  expert
  m_tile
  slice_begin, slice_count
  valid_rows
```

The acquisition policy is compile-time specialized:

```text
PersistentRangeSource   stride through an arithmetic materialized domain
MaterializedQueueSource atomically claim from a complete domain
ReadyQueueSource        pop incrementally published items
```

All policies feed the same FC1/activation/FC2 body.  Materialized grid and
queue sources derive most metadata arithmetically; the ready source loads all
fields because publication order is not arithmetic.  The item lives in a CuTe
rmem tensor so roles do not repeatedly reload shared control state.

This is the useful unification boundary.  W4A4, W4A8, and W4A16 need not share
one GEMM mainloop: their operand transport and MMA contracts are genuinely
different.  Route readiness and work ownership no longer need to be entangled
with those arithmetic choices.

## Native W4A8 convergence

Native W4A8 uses one dynamic-kernel family across the larger routed range and a
dedicated direct-route micro pipeline for eligible decode capacities through
eight tokens. The dynamic dense specialization combines:

- token-major input quantization with expert-major route metadata;
- N256/K128 lane-major prepared weights for N128-aligned geometry, or an exact
  N128-bulk/N64-tail representation when the intermediate width ends in 64;
- M32 FC1 work with queue or persistent-grid acquisition;
- a materialized E4M3 intermediate with transposed scale planes;
- flattened grid-stride full-K FC2 work;
- register-resident work metadata and compile-time-specialized control flow.

The DeepSeek V4.1 micro pipeline consumes the same planner-owned representation.
Its FC1 projection zero-fills the unused half of an N64 boundary tile, activation
materialization publishes a padded N128 operand with zero values and scale bytes,
and FC2 reads only the exact K32 extent. Live route counts remain runtime launch
arguments, so one prewarmed capacity plan serves multiple counts and CUDA graph
replays without resolving another kernel.

The earlier M=1 dynamic regime on the DSV4F TP2 shape reduced cold-L2
CUDA-graph time from 95.7 to 88.1 us while preserving a 0.999936 cosine match
to the reference.

The standalone staged pipeline was removed after the unified kernel won every
tested common DSV4 point on GPU 9 with `benchmark_moe.py`, CUDA graph replay,
and L2 flushing:

| TP | Tokens | Unified dynamic (µs) | Removed staged baseline (µs) | Change |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2 | 256 | 1715.2 | 1891.9 | -9.3% |
| 2 | 512 | 1855.6 | 1901.1 | -2.4% |
| 2 | 768 | 1763.9 | 1920.0 | -8.1% |
| 2 | 1024 | 1905.7 | 1948.7 | -2.2% |
| 2 | 2048 | 2405.5 | 2617.4 | -8.1% |
| 4 | 256 | 923.6 | 1026.6 | -10.0% |
| 4 | 512 | 969.8 | 1026.1 | -5.5% |
| 4 | 768 | 936.5 | 1033.2 | -9.4% |
| 4 | 1024 | 1003.6 | 1061.4 | -5.4% |
| 4 | 2048 | 1300.1 | 1464.9 | -11.2% |

The geometric-mean improvements are 6.1% at TP2 and 8.3% at TP4.  Removing
the old path also removes its 48-row route padding, capacity workspace,
standalone input quantizer, activation/quantizer, grouped GEMMs, inverse-route
map, weighted-sum kernel, dispatch thresholds, and graph-warmup contract.

## Scheduler measurements beyond W4A8

Direct arithmetic decoding is still useful when the fused task domain is
regular.  The true persistent-grid specialization removed queue-control
broadcasts and reduced executed instructions for W4A4.  At DSV4 batch 1024 it
improved TP4 from about 1153 to 1134 µs and TP2 from about 2072 to 2051 µs.

It is not universally better.  At TP2 batch 2048 the grid measured about 2959
µs versus 2802 µs for the queue.  This is the same rule at a different point:
static ownership is best in the regular middle band, while work stealing
absorbs the large-domain tail.  Scheduler selection is therefore a shape and
phase policy under one kernel, not a separate precision-specific kernel.

## One-owner API

Preparation is a lifecycle state, not a promise of a second allocation. The
public path has one direction:

```text
plan weights -> prepare one expert owner -> plan scratch -> bind -> run
```

`plan_b12x_fp4_moe_weights` chooses the representation and storage policy.
`prepare_b12x_fp4_moe_weights` executes that decision once and returns the sole
`B12XFP4ExpertWeights` owner. Scratch and launch planning derive source format,
activation, dtype, geometry, and W13 order from that owner's plan. Binding takes
the owner—not raw weight tensors—and execution takes only the completed binding.

| Requested runtime recipe | Planned storage | Preparation action |
|---|---|---|
| NVFP4 or W4A8-on-NVFP4 | source-native bytes with MMA views | keep the source allocation; derive runtime alphas |
| W4A16 source-native | source-native bytes | transfer the source allocation into the expert owner |
| W4A16 MMA-packed | packed MMA layout | repack the source allocation in place |
| native W4A8-MX | N256/K128 QMMA weights, or exact N128-bulk/N64-tail weights, plus SFB scales | repack weights and scales in place |
| source-native plus an incompatible model-sized repack, or two incompatible repacks | none | reject during planning |

There is no runtime raw-weight overload, prepared-payload override, old cache-key
fallback, or source-plus-repack serving state. Internal representation payloads
are not exported from `b12x.integration`.

## End state

The code now has:

1. one semantic/execution vocabulary;
2. one rmem work-item interface in the dynamic kernel;
3. compile-time queue, persistent-grid, and ready-queue acquisition policies;
4. one native-W4A8 prepared representation consumed by dynamic and direct micro execution;
5. phase-local scheduling where rectangular work justifies it;
6. one planner-owned preparation and execution API with one weight owner.

The remaining specialization is intentional: precision selects operand
transport and MMA instructions; availability constrains legal schedulers; and
measured cost variance selects among those schedulers.
